# Flappy-Bird
Flappy Bird with Anime avatars  - made in Python using Pygame

A modified flappy bird style game, made to teach myself sprite animation and how to make endless side-scroll games. 
Made based on the following tutorial:

# How to run

Run the 'FlappyBird.exe' file as a normal application or if Python and Pygame are installed to your device run 'menu.py'.

**//IMPORTANT: If on Windows in Settings under 'Display' change 'Scale and Layout' to 100%//**

This game is designed for fullscreen capacity and will be unplayable at other scales.

# What I learnt

- Functional programming with pygame
- sprite animation
- creating an endless looping game
- game states i.e. active or over
- basic physics (gravity) implementation
- using functions to pass variables between files
- using functions to minimise code length and maximise readability
